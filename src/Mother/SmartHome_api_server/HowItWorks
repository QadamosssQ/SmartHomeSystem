1. On your device, log in to your account using the access point, with credentials previously
created on the main web page hosted on the local server.
2. The device will retrieve the user secret by accessing the "/login" endpoint.
3. The device sends the user secret to the "/RegisterDevice" endpoint via the API, receiving
a device secret in response, which it stores in embedded memory.
4. On the web page, implement a refresh procedure to display the newly registered devices.
5. You can now control your device through the web interface.
